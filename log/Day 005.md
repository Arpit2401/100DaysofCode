# #100DaysofCode Challenege Day 005

## Tasks Done
* I solved 'Can Place Flower' Problem on Leetcode.
* I created DSA Repository and added Array Document with all it's specification.
* I revised concepts of django from youtube and started a project shown in the tutorial as well. 

## Additional Thoughts
* Took up django after several months, I nearly forget everything about it and hence, I have to go through the basics once again.
